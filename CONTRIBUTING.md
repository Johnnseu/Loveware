I guess that you are reading this message because you want to contribute to this "little" project.
I can assure you that it is very easy to do.

The only thing you need to do is upload your file with the code or paste it in the "Issues" tab of this code in "Issue" #1: "Add your code to Loveware"

Another way to do it is to fordk this repo and create a pull request with your version of Loveware.

After you have used one of the methods I mentioned you will only need to wait untill I approve it.

Hopefully your code join us soon!!!
